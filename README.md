# Extracting relevant information from Cochrane reviews
This repository contains the updated version of the implementation of rules for automatically extracting relevant information from Cochrane reviews. Original implementation: https://github.com/Rabia-Bashir/rules_data_ext/  Credit to: Rabia Bashir.

### Environment
---
The code was built and tested on:
* python 2.7.16 (Anaconda)
* sklearn: 0.20.3
* numpy: 1.16.5
* OS X El Capitan v10.11.6

### Note
---
Please note that the newer version of some libraries from scikit-learn used in this code might have different default values for the parameters, or, different available parameters, which could give different results.

### Usage
---
* crawler.py
**Default setting**
This code will read a list of DOI in 'Datasets/DOI.csv' and download the reviews with .pub2 (original version) and .pub3 (updated version) from Cochrane library. The downloaded HTML files are saved to HTML_SystematicReviews folder.

Specifically, the crawler will download:
- 'http://cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/{}/full'
- 'http://cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/{}/references'
- 'http://cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/{}/information'
where {} is the DOI

Alternatively, the downloaded HTML files are also included in this repository.

* extractor.py
**Default setting**
This code will extract relevant information from the respective HTML files:
- Search date
&nbsp;Abstract > Search methods, in the HTML file downloaded from 'http://cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/{}/full', where {} is the DOI
- Number of trials, number of participants in each trial
&nbsp;Characteristics of studies > Characteristics of included studies, in the HTML file downloaded from 'http://cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/{}/references', where {} is the DOI
- Conclusion
&nbsp;What's New and History, in the HTML file downloaded from 'http://cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/{}/information'

The output is 'extracted_info.txt' in 'Results/' folder.






* classifiers.py
**Running the code**
Type   python classifiers.py    on the console, or run classifiers.py from IDE. A menu will appear:
```
[1] Run default setting and load previous trained classifiers
[2] Run default setting and retrained the classifiers
[3] Enter your own results folder
```
**[1] Default setting and load previous trained classifiers**
This choice will:
- Read 'extracted_info.txt' in 'Results/' folder, and translate to features in 'Results/features.txt'
- Split into 80% for training set (not used), and 20% as test set.
- Load previous trained classifiers in 'Results/cpickle/' folder and reproduce the results on the 20% test set

**[2] Default setting and retrained the classifiers**
This choice will:
- Read 'extracted_info.txt' in 'Results/' folder, and translate to features in 'Results/features.txt'
- Split into 80% for training set (not used), and 20% as test set.
- Retrained classifiers using the 80% training set, and reproduce the results on the 20% test set.

**[3] Using your own results folder**
You can create your own folder to separate the results, however, this folder should be in the same directory with the classifier.py and has 


The code contains 3 classifiers: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. The classifiers are trained using 80% of dataset and tested using the rest 20%.
